--- abstract


This document intends to clarify the terminology related to the management
in constrained environments.

--- middle

# Introduction

This document tries to define the main aspects related to management of constrained
nodes/devices.

{{RFC7547}} describes the problem statements and requirements in the management of Networks
with constrained devices. {{RFC7548}} describes the use cases involving the management of networks in which constrained
devices are involved.


# Terminology and Requirements Language

<!-- The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", -->
<!-- "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this -->
<!-- document are to be interpreted as described -->
<!-- in [RFC 2119](#RFC2119). -->
<!-- I don't think we need RFC2119 language in this document. -->

Terminology defined in {{RFC7228}} applies to this document.


# Management in IoT Terminology in IETF related work

TBD.


# Management in IoT Terminology

The terminology can be organized in the zones depicted in {{fig_DevMgtDescrp}}.

Device Management (DM): It involves the management of the device
itself e.g. firmware update functionalities.

Following OMA Standard {{OMA-DM}}, Device Management is the procedure
that involves the configuration of a device and maintenance tasks such as software updates.

Resource Management (RM): It involves the management of the resources of
a device or network?. Or should RM involve only resources of DM and not resources
of NM?

Routing Management (RtM): It involves the management of the forwarding functionalities
of a device.

Gateway Management (GwM): It involves the management of the functionalities
of devices to forward the information outside of the network or to Internet.

Network Management (GwM): It involves the management of the Network.
See {{RFC6632}} for an overview.

{{fig_DevMgtDescrp}} shows that some Device Management Functionalities would be part
of Network Management? Such as configuration of network interface?

TODO Add further explanation of the figure.


# Device Management

Following OMA Specifications {{OMA-DM}}, device management comprises management of a device configuration
and other managed objects of devices from the point of view of the management
authorities such
as a network operator or a hardware device.

## Device Management FCAPS - OAM?

Device management is related to define the functionalities to handle the
devices basically in control plane,
such as firmware update and check the battery levels. Including, s
setting initial configuration information in devices,
subsequent installation and updates of persistent information in devices,
retrieval of management information from devices,
processing events and alarms generated by devices {{OMA-DM}}.

TODO Add other functionalities - FCAPS? - OAM?
